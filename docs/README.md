# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documents. These docs capture how we initiate, plan, execute, release, and improve project work so teams can deliver predictable, measurable outcomes.

Summary
- Lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- Principles: customer-first, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, psychological safety.
- Core roles: Project Manager (PM), Product Manager (PdM), Developers, QA, Stakeholders.
- Key artifacts: Project One-pager (charter), prioritized backlog, Definition of Done, Risk Register, Release plan, Retrospectives and action items.
- Typical cadence: daily standups, weekly delivery sync, sprint demos, monthly stakeholder updates.
- Quality & risk controls: CI tests and security scans, smoke tests before release, risk register + escalation paths.
